brdev,Java 17 e Java 21,"Não tem Google no seu computador? 


A especificação Java é aberta e pública qualquer um pode pesquisar o que mudou do Java 1 pro 18 e pro 19 e pro 20....


Sério se você precisa vir no reddit perguntar isso você ten problemas bem maiores que a versão Java usada no código "
brdev,Java 17 e Java 21,"Acho  que o mais interessante agora é que as threads virtuais deram uma amadurecida, então da pra usar com mais confiança e junto veio o scopped value pra facilitar  o trabalho no ambito de multithread dentro de contextos e com imutabilidade garantida. Isso é mais pra quem trabalha com concorrência ou programação reativa.
Outra coisa que eu gostei bastante é do sequenced Collections que trouxe outra forma de trabalhar com as collections."
brdev,Java 17 e Java 21,"O gamechanger do Java 21 é as virtual threads (ex project loom). Os majors frameworks já permitem executar requests em VT. Excepcional ganho, mas pode não ser ideal pra todos os casos devido a thread pinning."

brdev,Pode usar Vscode para para programar em JAVA?,"usa oq você quiser mano, eu ein"
brdev,Pode usar Vscode para para programar em JAVA?,"Rapaz, se vc quiser programar em assembly no bloco de notas, vc faz, não tem polícia do código pra te pegar não"
brdev,Pode usar Vscode para para programar em JAVA?,Usar o Intellij é caminho sem volta. É simplesmente muito bom.
brdev,Pode usar Vscode para para programar em JAVA?,"Rapaz, dá pra usar até notepad."
brdev,Pode usar Vscode para para programar em JAVA?,"Problema do VS Code é que ele costuma ser muito cru pra tudo que não seja Javascript, pelo menos na minha experiência. Até C# que em teoria deveria ter um bom suporte por ser da Microsoft fica muito pra trás de um Visual Studio Community por exemplo.

O que acontece é que com IDEs especializadas você ganha muita produtividade, porque elas já assumem muita coisa e funcionam logo de cara, ao invés de outras IDEs mais genéricas como o VS Code que exige mais configuração e cuidado."

learnjava,Best resources to learn Java,Honestly having just gone through the MOOC parts 1 & 2 I can see why it's recommended so much here. If you complete all the exercises it really solidifies things. The next step after the MOOC is a little hazy but books like java concurrency in practice and effective java get recommended a lot.
learnjava,Best resources to learn Java,"It seems that you are looking for resources for learning Java.

In our *sidebar* (""About"" on mobile), we have a section ""Free Tutorials"" where we list the most commonly recommended courses.

learnjava,Best resources to learn Java,"I'll work on the demos available on Springboot official website. Even though the threads are old, on the industry a large portion uses old versions of java (8, 11); on Disney we used java 11 and in my current role we use the 11 version too, so ""old books"" will still be relevant and useful in a work environment. For practical advice: Effective Java and Spring in action; then I'd check a book on multi threading"
