SquaredCircle,"Tito Santana: ""Making my return to WWE Saturday night…See ya there ARRIBA @WWE""",I’m glad there’s some 80s talent representation on the show. So many guys from that era are no longer with us.
SquaredCircle,"Tito Santana: ""Making my return to WWE Saturday night…See ya there ARRIBA @WWE""",The Body is going to have to be careful with Tito.  That stuff he used to say about him in the 80s definitely won't fly today.
SquaredCircle,"Tito Santana: ""Making my return to WWE Saturday night…See ya there ARRIBA @WWE""","It's nice to see Tito and Hammer together. Still say they had the best IC feud of all-time. Hammer breaking Tito's leg and then Tito winning it back in a cage only for Greg to then break the IC belt for Tito to debut the famous black gold version.

Stuff like that made me a fan."

martialarts,Wwe in real life 🔥,"I didn't expect him to go for another takedown after being thrown on the ground the first time 😁

Regardless of frame and skills, that guy surely has balls."
martialarts,Wwe in real life 🔥,Little dude is lucky big bro didn't throw him on his head.
martialarts,Wwe in real life 🔥,when people think strength doesn't matter
martialarts,Wwe in real life 🔥,"Little dude is lucky that big boy didn’t dump him on his dome. He was actually considerate in that regard, especially on that pile driver, geesh… he could’ve had a leaky melon after that! 🤕😵💀"

SquaredCircle,Shotzi: I love my friends ☺️ @gigidolin_wwe @tatumpaxley_wwe,"Shotzi is one of those people who has an NXT buff. Her presentation always seems a little better (Black and Gold or Shawn running things, NXT understands that Shotzi is camp), her promos come off better, her matches. I think the Gigi, Tatum, Shotzi pairing (with occasional visits from Lyra, if you're peeping this board, Shawn) is a group with a lot of potential, if they wish to make it something a little more long/medium term.

Peak Shotzi absurdity is the segment in late Black and Gold, where Stone and Aliyah are backstage, and they see Shotzi working on her tank, and Stone decides to try to recruit her. She tells him to buzz off, he gets so exasperated he throws his coffee behind him, it gets all over Big Damo, who just happened to be walking by, who then beats Stone's ass, throws him down, Shotzi runs him over with the tank, howls, and walks off while Stone screams like he's actually dying. Look it up if you've never seen it, like a minute and a half of insanity."
