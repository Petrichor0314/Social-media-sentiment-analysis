If u know how to use gpt but can't code, you will become a rich influencer."

ITCareerQuestions,Programming heavy IT jobs?,"SRE or DevOps. DevOps leans more SysAdmin and scripting.  SRE leans more programmer, where you are writing APIs."
ITCareerQuestions,Programming heavy IT jobs?,"In terms of IT and Infrastructure... DevOps would be what you're looking for, this position would use languages such as PowerShell, Bash, Pearl, Python, JSON, and YAML. Typically speaking you will have to become either a Sysadmin or Netadmin first if you wish to move into a Devops role."
HamsterAndGretel,JANUARY 2025 PROGRAMMING HIGHLIGHTS,I have a gut feeling that “Awkwardly Ever After” is going to either make or break this show’s fanbase
fundiesnarkfreespeech,“Programming” she says🥴🙄🙄🙄🤡🤡🤡,No one is going to give you backlash for choosing that for yourself!!! It’s when you *insist* that all women must do that and it’s the only way they’ll be happy. And you *deserve* backlash for that! Make your own damn choices and let other people make theirs.
fundiesnarkfreespeech,“Programming” she says🥴🙄🙄🙄🤡🤡🤡,"Back in the “good old days” Solie would be sitting in the back of the bus or picking cotton in the fields. I know plenty of old, southern black women who would tear her a new one."
fundiesnarkfreespeech,“Programming” she says🥴🙄🙄🙄🤡🤡🤡,"""tight nit""...so a tight louse egg? I honestly think she protests WAY too much. Who says that having a career means that we don't have multi-generational households, have a group of close friends, are capable of doing all those other ""feminine"" things? 

At one point there were 4 generations of my family living in my house. That's not unusual in my culture (Latino family). I'm down to 2 generations, soon to be 3 generations in my home. 

What's with this ""YAH"" bullshit and attempting to cosplay semi-Jew? These morons have no concept of what marriage is like in the Jewish communities (hint, nothing like the Christians). Ok...I'm beyond pissed and will stop now."
fundiesnarkfreespeech,“Programming” she says🥴🙄🙄🙄🤡🤡🤡,"The difference between me and Solie? Solie is desperately trying to convince herself that being a SAHM is valid. 

I’m a SAHM and I don’t give a shit if anyone has a problem with it. Being a SAHM is what works for my family right now and my husband has the earning power to make it happen, and if and when it doesn’t, I have the right and more importantly the ability to change things around. 

Solie is begging for external validation so badly that she has to make up ahistorical bullshit and convince herself that the majority didn’t want feminism. Cool story. Cite your sources, babe."
fundiesnarkfreespeech,“Programming” she says🥴🙄🙄🙄🤡🤡🤡,"Does Solie think Mildred Loving should have kept quiet at home instead of challenging the Racial Integrity Act in Virginia? Would Solie's parents have been allowed to marry if the Supreme Court hadn't ruled in favor of the Lovings?

Lil miss delusional prick needs to take several seats, for starters."

conspiracy,Best predictive programming doc ?,"I'm always eager to help a new conspiracy theorist join the fold! Welcome! Tinfoil hats are available in the gift store!

Predictive programming is one of those more technical conspiracies. Much more complex than ""look aliens!"" I'm sure there are some docs out there but I'm not familiar with any good ones.

With more technical stuff like this videos are going to be harder to come by and you'll often have to tread into literature.

The bible of predictive programming is a book called ""Manufacturing Consent."" It's a book about how the government and especially the media manipulate people into thinking they want what the government wants. It's basically a take on government propaganda.

I think this would be the best place for you to start your research into predictive programming.

P.S. I haven't looked for the book in a while but I would not be surprised if it's out of print and hard to find just like most books that tell too much truth. ""They"" like to bury these books. If you can't find anything you're looking for including this book always try Archive.org."
conspiracy,Best predictive programming doc ?,"Oooh I forgot to mention The Why Files on YouTube.

Check it out. Dude has high quality videos that go over great details about all the conspiracies. I've been in this shit for years and I'm always learning something new from his channel. Ignore the fish. You'll get used to him.

This video talks about the bilderberg group and the general illuminati agenda.
