bookporn,Addicted to her books,Which one is your favorite? Which one would you recommend starting with?
bookporn,Addicted to her books,"I really liked her writing until I read The Last Mrs. Parrish and then The Housemaid after - they were so similar I had to look into it and found many people think the same thing, she plagiarized it as well as several other's. I won't read any more of her books"
bookporn,Addicted to her books,I read never lie by her but when I tried to read the coworker and another one I really just couldn’t get through them.
bookporn,Addicted to her books,I am reading ‘Never Lie’ by her at the moment . I hope it’s good. Has anyone read it?
bookporn,Addicted to her books,I’ve only read the inmate but that was damn good. I want to get more into her work
