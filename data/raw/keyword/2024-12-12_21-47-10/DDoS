cybersecurity,Europol Dismantles 27 DDoS Attack Platforms Across 15 Nations; Admins Arrested,"This post links to The Hacker News (THN). The moderators of r/cybersecurity strive to maintain a professional subreddit which will often discuss news, and further acknowledge that THN is a popular source of news within the cybersecurity community at large. We always wish to act in the best interests of the community and will not restrict news content which is accurate and valuable.

However, it has come to our attention that THN has been accused of plagiarism since at least 2012 (ref: [attrition.org](https://attrition.org/errata/plagiarism/thehackernews/)), allegedly copying article contents from original authors and modifying them without appropriately crediting the original source. Their behavior has been met with repeated criticism, including making false statements (ref: [@thegrugq](https://twitter.com/thegrugq/status/902600568262107136)) and renewed claims of plagiarism (refs: [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18783493) c. 2018, [reddit.com](https://reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/mczutz/the_hacker_news_profiting_off_extensive/) c. 2021). Due to these incidents, THN links have been banned from several subreddits including r/privacy, r/technology, and r/hacking.

We would hope that THN is now appropriately crediting sources of its content or writing its own original content, however we are unable to police each and every article. Please ensure that the information in this article is factual, and where possible, please choose to support high-quality ethical journalism directly. If the community feels this warning is no longer relevant, we will remove this AutoModerator action. Thank you.

tutanota,Techradar - Tuta has suffered multiple DDoS attacks in one week – but it claims privacy has not been compromised,"A few key excerpts from the article:

>*While Tuta users couldn't access their mailbox for some time, Bozakov ensures that no emails received during the attack have been lost or users' privacy has been compromised. She said: ""\[Users' data\] is encrypted end-to-end on our servers, and no data has been harmed. The attacks only aim at the availability of our service.""*

And

>*If you are still experiencing issues accessing your inbox, this could mean your IP adress has been blocked during the attacks by Tuta's DDoS protection system.*

>*...//...VPN apps could help here as it spoofs your IP by assigning you another one for each session. Bear in mind, though, that VPNs could also have been blocked by Tuta's mitigation systems as many people tried to use them during the attack.*

>*Bozakov then suggests rather using a completely different connection to access your Tuta's app, such as another WI-Fi or mobile internet data.*

I think this will be important and might help alleviate some users concern:

>*The provider is still analyzing the attacks at the time of writing and is set to publish a detailed report of what happened in the coming days.*"
tutanota,Techradar - Tuta has suffered multiple DDoS attacks in one week – but it claims privacy has not been compromised,"These attacks just make me think that Tuta is doing something right!

It's like the whole furore over the allegations by that bloke a while back that they were a 'honeypot'. That's exactly what someone would say who wanted people to not use them. It made me think, why are they singled out in particular? Are they harder to crack than the competition? 

And just my two pennorth - Tuta, spend your time and money on making the system even more DDoS resilient etc. Not on extra features or products. We just want top-notch email."
tutanota,Techradar - Tuta has suffered multiple DDoS attacks in one week – but it claims privacy has not been compromised,I signed up to transfer from proton. I’m no expert but this has made me indecisive.
tutanota,Techradar - Tuta has suffered multiple DDoS attacks in one week – but it claims privacy has not been compromised,I have no issue with using Tuta the past few weeks. I don't even know about the existence of these ddos attacks.
tutanota,Techradar - Tuta has suffered multiple DDoS attacks in one week – but it claims privacy has not been compromised,I went ahead and transferred to proton today. It's crazy they're trying to push for sales on their Black Friday deal but they can't even maintain their servers I've had them for 2 years and the network goes down a lot more than that.
