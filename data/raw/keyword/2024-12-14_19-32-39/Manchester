MCFC,[Pre Match Thread] Manchester City vs Manchester United (Premier League),Manchester City are still alive here….
MCFC,[Pre Match Thread] Manchester City vs Manchester United (Premier League),Mad that if we win this we're still in 4th.
MCFC,[Pre Match Thread] Manchester City vs Manchester United (Premier League),We both are playing shit. But I think our shit version is better than theirs
reddevils,[Pre Match Thread] Premier League Game 16 | Manchester City vs Manchester United,Mount and Hojlund have to start. Wouldn’t mind seeing Antony either.
reddevils,[Pre Match Thread] Premier League Game 16 | Manchester City vs Manchester United,"Anthony Taylor 

Fuck me. Hope he doesn’t make an already hard game harder"
reddevils,[Pre Match Thread] Premier League Game 16 | Manchester City vs Manchester United,"City have a bunch of players out, and have not looked impressive at all when they don't have possession. Gaps in midfield, defensive lapses, miscommunications, all the stuff we've been used to seeing from United over the last few years. Their best players have been out of form and the whole squad looks sullen and tetchy. 

If they beat us, it won't be a case of, ""well, they're just so much stronger and so much more seasoned and embedded in the way they play"" like it has been in previous seasons. It will be because we missed a real opportunity to do them."
reddevils,[Pre Match Thread] Premier League Game 16 | Manchester City vs Manchester United,"What a weird Manchester Derby this is. Legit anything could happen and it wouldn't feel surprising. I really hope the players can actually revel in the fact a local rival is struggling and vulnerable. If they don't feel like running and pressing to win the derby, there's no hope for them."
reddevils,[Pre Match Thread] Premier League Game 16 | Manchester City vs Manchester United,"Would just be like us to kick start City's season for them 

I have a terrible feeling about this game. They are a wounded animal and we are a squad filled with gentle herbivores who simply want to graze and drink a bit of water

As shite as City have been in the last 10 games, they'll be bang up for this. It could be an absolute blood bath."
