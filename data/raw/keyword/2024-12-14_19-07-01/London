LondonUnderground,London's train lengths,"I made this for my own interest initially but thought it was good enough to share.

Confirms my belief that the Thameslink trains are very very long, sometimes I feel like the front of the train is arriving at City Thameslink before the back of the train has left Blackfriars.

Though the Elizabeth Line trains are certainly long bois as well.

A few notes:

* The new Piccadilly Line trains (2024TS) will be slightly longer at 113m.
* Each DLR car is actually two articulated cars, so 3-car is really 6-car in a sense.
* The new walkthrough 5-car DLR trains coming soon are the same length as an existing 3-car unit.
* London Overground (8-car) is two coupled Class 710 units as used on the Weaver Line.
* London Overground (5-car) is Class 378 on the Mildmay or Windrush or Class 710 on the Mildmay.
* London Overground (4-car) is Class 710 on the Suffragette/Lioness/Liberty lines.
* The two models of Tramlink train are slightly different lengths at 30m and 32m, so went with 31m.

Here's another version with the Overground lines split and a few extra comedy options for completeness:

Let me know if I made any errors!"
LondonUnderground,London's train lengths,Thanks! Any reason why the chart includes Thameslink but not the other National Rail services? Is it because it‚Äôs the only one appearing on the tube map?

LondonUnderground,London's train lengths,Didn't know the Weaver trains were that long. Is the route really that heavily used?
