youtubedrama,"MrBeast Employees Speak Out: ""Everyone Gets Hurt""","keeping this one up since the last one had a really weird upvote ratio for something like this of an 11%. normally posts like this do not get this ratio, especially when the comments were clearly in favor of the video on that post. (while some negative ones, they were downvoted, while the ones arguing against it were positive)

it struck me as suspicious tbh, plus it does have some new information towards the mr beast drama that are important along with old information that is now relevant towards the current drama.

EDIT: ok so, i definitely think bots are involved here

  
EDIT AGAIN: as of writing this, the post has some upvotes, but here the timeline for why bots are involved: started out with 24 upvotes, then goes to 0 (assumed to be in the negatives) then climbs back up to 2. should not the comments that have upvotes are the ones positive towards the post, making the lack of upvotes more suspicious"

mrbeastsnark,New MrBeast Allegations From Former Employees,"I feel bad for Matt, I didn’t believe him back when he first came out about this. Every account you hear just reconfirms that the company was/is a toxic boys club. 

I would hope they can make the changes in the company to stop this since the have been called out, but given who they are associating with now, it certainly seems like the boys club mentality is still flourishing."
mrbeastsnark,New MrBeast Allegations From Former Employees,Another MrBeast employee speaks out.
mrbeastsnark,New MrBeast Allegations From Former Employees,"Turner emphasizing that Mrbeast and his team constantly talked about Loli at work is pretty big. Also discussed yet another charity video being exaggerated by up to $80,000 dollars, showing a definite trend of lying about how 'giving' he is."
