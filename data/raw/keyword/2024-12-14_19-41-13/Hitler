clevercomebacks,Trump and Hitler have something in common ,Elon’s man crush on Trump is so embarrassing.
clevercomebacks,Trump and Hitler have something in common ,Man I can’t believe there are people out there who think that TIME’s person of the year is some massive endorsement. I guess folks will believe whatever they want to
clevercomebacks,Trump and Hitler have something in common ,"It’s a statement that he was the most influential or newsworthy, not the best. He’s like an awful toddler who thinks any attention is good "
clevercomebacks,Trump and Hitler have something in common ,"I don’t get how people like Elon and trump have so much goddamn time to be chronically on social media. Like you have immense wealth you could never use up, power beyond belief, yet you still spend a huge percentage of your time typing your fingers furiously and scrolling through mind numbing nonsense like the rest of the plebs?

It shows just how addictive and mindrotting social media has become. Elon could literally do the most fun thing most of us could imagine doing once in our life every day, and instead he spends most of his time doing the same stupid shit everyone else does."
clevercomebacks,Trump and Hitler have something in common ,Yeah and I was person of the year in 2006. It means nothing. He's weirdly obsessed with these awards.

Pareidolia,Amazon Hitler,"If this is true people are reaching for an issue to complain about. In what way do either app icons look like Hitler? Arguably the one to the left could also look like Samantha the American girl doll, Wednesday Adams,  Zooey Deschanel, Wendy Torrance or literally anyone who has had bangs. This is stupid. I wish the App just said a2z so I wouldn't mix it up with my contact list."
